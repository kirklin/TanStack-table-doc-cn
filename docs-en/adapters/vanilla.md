The `@tanstack/table-core` library contains the core logic for TanStack Table. If you are using a non-standard framework or don't have access to a framework, you can use the core library directly via TypeScript or JavaScript.

## `createTable`

Takes an `options` object and returns a table.

```tsx
import { createTable } from '@tanstack/table-core'

const table = createTable(options)
```
