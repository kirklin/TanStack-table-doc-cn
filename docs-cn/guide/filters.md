## Overview

Filters come in two flavors:

- Column filters
  - A filter that is applied to a single column's accessor value.
  - Stored in the `state.columnFilters` array as an object containing the columnId and the filter value.
- Global filters
  - A single filter value that is applied to all or some of columns' accessor values.
  - Stored in the `state.globalFilter` array as any value, usually a string.
